Online Game Store
=================

This application is a simple Online Game Store consisting “seller”
entities and their game collections built with **Lagom** showcasing the
principles of **Event Sourcing** and **CQRS**. It is a single service
containing two parts; API and Implementation handling the management of
the store by providing create,read,update and delete **(CRUD)**
functions for Sellers and Games.

For simplicity, no authentication is implemented, seller and game IDs
are generated by random UUID. In a real world application, these IDs
would be validated against a database.

This release is a base version lacking some unit tests and validations
which will be added later.
